AT2G47460	AT2G47460.1	MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy.  The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.	protein_coding	MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 12 (MYB12)	MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 12 (MYB12);MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 12 (ATMYB12);PRODUCTION OF FLAVONOL GLYCOSIDES 1 (PFG1)

AT3G20880	AT3G20880.1	WIP4 is a paralog of NTT and along with WIP5,acts redundantly in cell fate determination during primary root development. MP binds to AuxRE motifs within the WIP4 gene and likely regulates its expression.	protein_coding	WIP DOMAIN PROTEIN 4 (WIP4)	WIP DOMAIN PROTEIN 4 (WIP4)
AT5G49520	AT5G49520.1	Encodes WRKY48, a member of the WRKY Transcription Factor. WRKY48 is a stress- and pathogen-induced transcriptional activator that represses plant basal defense. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	protein_coding	WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 48 (WRKY48)	ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 48 (ATWRKY48);WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 48 (WRKY48)
AT5G11320	AT5G11320.1	Belongs to the YUC gene family.  Encodes a predicted flavin monooxygenase YUC4 involved in auxin biosynthesis and plant development.	protein_coding	YUCCA4 (YUC4)	 (ATYUC4);YUCCA4 (YUC4)
AT1G69600	AT1G69600.1	Encodes ZFHD1, a member of the zinc finger homeodomain transcriptional factor family.  Binds to the 62 bp promoter region of ERD1 (early responsive to dehydration stress 1).  Expression of ZFHD1 is induced by drought, high salinity and abscisic acid.	protein_coding	ZINC FINGER HOMEODOMAIN  1 (ZFHD1)	ZINC FINGER HOMEODOMAIN  1 (ZFHD1);ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 29 (ATHB29);ZINC FINGER HOMEODOMAIN 11 (ZHD11)
AT1G24625	AT1G24625.1	Encodes a zinc finger protein containing only a single zinc finger.	protein_coding	ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 7 (ZFP7)	ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 7 (ZFP7)
